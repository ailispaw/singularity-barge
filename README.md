# Singularity on Barge with Vagrant

[Singularity](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity) is an open source container platform designed to be simple, fast, and secure.

> Singularity is optimized for EPC and HPC workloads, allowing untrusted users to run untrusted containers in a trusted way.

This repo creates an environment to use Singularity on [Barge](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/ailispaw/boxes/barge) with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) instantly.

## Requirements

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

## Boot up

```
$ vagrant up
```

That's it.

Now you can use `singularity` on the Barge VM.

```
$ vagrant ssh
Welcome to Barge 2.10.1, Docker version 1.10.3, build 20f81dd
[bargee@barge ~]$ singularity -h

Linux container platform optimized for High Performance Computing (HPC) and
Enterprise Performance Computing (EPC)

Usage:
  singularity [global options...]

Description:
  Singularity containers provide an application virtualization layer enabling
  mobility of compute via both application and environment portability. With
  Singularity one is capable of building a root file system that runs on any
  other Linux system where Singularity is installed.

Options:
  -d, --debug              print debugging information (highest verbosity)
  -h, --help               help for singularity
  -q, --quiet              suppress normal output
  -s, --silent             only print errors
  -t, --tokenfile string   path to the file holding your sylabs
                           authentication token (default
                           "/home/bargee/.singularity/sylabs-token")
  -v, --verbose            print additional information
      --version            version for singularity

Available Commands:
  apps        apps <image path>
  build       Build a new Singularity container
  cache       Manage your local singularity cache
  capability  Manage Linux capabilities on containers
  exec        Execute a command within container
  help        Help about any command
  inspect     Display metadata for container if available
  instance    Manage containers running in the background
  key         Manage OpenPGP key stores
  oci         Manage OCI containers
  pull        Pull a container from a URI
  push        Push a container to a Library URI
  run         Launch a runscript within container
  run-help    Display help for container if available
  search      Search the library
  shell       Run a Bourne shell within container
  sign        Attach cryptographic signatures to container
  test        Run defined tests for this particular container
  verify      Verify cryptographic signatures on container
  version     Show application version

Examples:
  $ singularity help <command>
      Additional help for any Singularity subcommand can be seen by appending
      the subcommand name to the above command.
